# Python Bing Wallpaper
This is a script for Mac os and Linux (with Gnome based DE) that sets a [Bing Photo of the day](http://www.bing.com/gallery/) as your wallpaper. Windows isn't supported, because it haa this feature built-in. Unfortunately, the resolution of the photos is only full-hd as of now - I hope Microsoft will change it soon.

## How to use it:
Just run `python3 main.py` in terminal, the script will download the photo and set it as wallpaper. You can create a daily cron job, launch it on startup, use Automator on mac os...

## Licence
Meh, I don't care what you do with this. You can copy, modify, redistribute this script all you want as long as you don't violate the Microsoft conditions about the content. Pull requests are welcomed.
